There is an additional model available from the ClearTK downloads page:

https://code.google.com/p/clearnlp/

and is called mayo-en-dep-1.3.0.jar.  This model is built from
both the training data and development data from the CoNLL 2009 shared task (see
links above).  This model was provided by Jinho Choi.

Notes
#####

- Both models were trained using PennTreebank part-of-speech tags.  So, your input part-of-speech
tags should match the tags used for training this model.  The part-of-speech tag for punctuation 
symbols such as "." "," ":" ";" "(" ")" etc. are the symbols themselves (i.e. the part-of-speech tag
for the token ")" should be ")".)  This may be inconsistent with other PTB-derived tagging schemes that
may use tags such as "COLON" or "RRB".  Your part-of-speech tags should be modified to be consistent with
the tagging scheme used here.

- The dependency labeling scheme produced by the models provided here is separate/different from that of
the Malt parser models used by ClearTK's wrapper of the Malt parser.  You should not assume that 
the wrapper for the Clear Parser can be used interchangeably with the wrapper for the Malt Parser.
